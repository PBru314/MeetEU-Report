\section{Introduction}

\section{Material and Methods}
\subsection{Lead Drug Enhancement}
In order to enhance the binding affinity of our drug candidates and thus their performance, we used AutoGrow4 to generate novel compounds. Starting with the best binding compounds of our initial docking simulation with AutoDock Vina as generation zero, multiple new structures are generated by combining sub-structures of the first generation or by passing them through a set of possible chemical reactions. All of the generated compounds are ranked by their binding affinity estimated by Vina or QuickVina. After passing several filters the best oerforming compounds are used as the seed for the next generation. Using this algorithm, compounds are found, which show higher binding affinities than the first generation. As AutoGrow4 labels all new structures by the path by which they were obtained, we can also evaluate the synthesizability.
