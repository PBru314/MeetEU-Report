\section{Abstract}
Even though the development of vaccines against Sars-CoV-2 was successful during the recent pandemic, the amount of FDA approved drugs for the therapy of Covid-19 is still limited to Paxlovid and Veklury, Olumiant and Actemra \cite{FDA_COVID}. One possibility to accelerate the development of new therapies for Covid19 is to screen already approved drugs for effects against the viral reproduction. In this years MeetEU project, we investigated the NSP13 helicase of Sars-CoV-2 and tried to find compounds that could be repurposed for this therapy, as well as novel compounds that could lead to an effective treatment of Covid19. Using our \textit{in-silico} pipeline enables us to evaluate possible drug candidates, suggest novel structures based on already approved drugs and investigate their toxicity, while being cheaper and less labor intensive than projects limited to wet-lab work.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Lead Drug Enhancement}
In order to enhance the binding affinity of our drug candidates and thus their performance, we used AutoGrow4 (Version 4.0.3) \cite{package_Autogrow4} to generate novel compounds. Starting with the best binding compounds of our initial docking simulation with AutoDock Vina as generation zero, multiple new structures are generated by combining sub-structures of the first generation or by passing them through a set of possible chemical reactions after converting them into their respective SMILES codes. All of the generated compounds are ranked by their binding affinity. After passing several filters the best performing compounds are used as the seed for the next generation. Using this algorithm, compounds are found, which show higher binding affinities than the first generation. As AutoGrow4 labels all new structures by the path by which they were obtained, we can also evaluate the synthesizability.  

\subsection{Molecular Dynamics Simulation}
As the last step of our pipeline, a MD simulation is conducted using the best scoring compounds as a ligand in the binding pocket of the NSP13 protein. Using GROMACS (Version 2023.3) \cite{package_GROMACS}, this enables us to interpret the stability of the protein-ligand interaction, as well as to identify important residues for the interaction. Using a given force-field, a set of equations describing different forces between the atoms and residues in the protein and ligand, the movement of all atoms in the system can be simulated and analysed. However, this is only possible in a very limited timeframe with a small time step size. As this process is rather resource heavy, it has to be conducted on a cluster with access to a GPU. 

\subsection{Estimation of Toxicity and Synthetic Accessibility}
 
Following successful discovery and optimisation of lead drug compounds, an evaluation of the chosen compoundsâ€™ general toxicity and synthetic accessibility was performed using \textit{e}ToxPred (\textbf{Citation}). This additional steps gives our study a reference to real-life application as it allows for a general estimation of the risk vs. benefit ratio through the Tox-score. Furthermore, it allows for an insight into the ease of synthesis, reflected by the synthetic accessibility score (SAscore), of the compounds in a laboratory setting. After having assessed the efficacy of the different drugs as CoVid treatment options, these two parameters give an insight into how realistic the compounds are for use as drugs.
