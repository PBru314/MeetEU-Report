  abstract = {MOTIVATION: The binding sites of proteins generally contain
              smaller regions that provide major contributions to the binding
              free energy and hence are the prime targets in drug design.
              Screening libraries of fragment-sized compounds by NMR or X-ray
              crystallography demonstrates that such 'hot spot' regions bind a
              large variety of small organic molecules, and that a relatively
              high 'hit rate' is predictive of target sites that are likely to
              bind drug-like ligands with high affinity. Our goal is to determine
              the 'hot spots' computationally rather than experimentally.
              RESULTS: We have developed the FTMAP algorithm that performs global
              search of the entire protein surface for regions that bind a number
              of small organic probe molecules. The search is based on the
              extremely efficient fast Fourier transform (FFT) correlation
              approach which can sample billions of probe positions on dense
              translational and rotational grids, but can use only sums of
              correlation functions for scoring and hence is generally restricted
              to very simple energy expressions. The novelty of FTMAP is that we
              were able to incorporate and represent on grids a detailed energy
              expression, resulting in a very accurate identification of
              low-energy probe clusters. Overlapping clusters of different probes
              are defined as consensus sites (CSs). We show that the largest CS
              is generally located at the most important subsite of the protein
              binding site, and the nearby smaller CSs identify other important
              subsites. Mapping results are presented for elastase whose
              structure has been solved in aqueous solutions of eight organic
              solvents, and we show that FTMAP provides very similar information.
              The second application is to renin, a long-standing pharmaceutical
              target for the treatment of hypertension, and we show that the
              major CSs trace out the shape of the first approved renin inhibitor
              , aliskiren. AVAILABILITY: FTMAP is available as a server at
              http://ftmap.bu.edu/.},

              inspect the predicted binding sites via an integrated
              sequence-structure view. Moreover, PrankWeb can determine sequence
              conservation for the input molecule and use this in both the
              prediction and result visualization steps. Alongside its online
              visualization options, PrankWeb also offers the possibility of
              exporting the results as a PyMOL script for offline visualization.
              The web frontend communicates with the server side via a REST API.

  abstract = {Predicting the binding structure of a small molecule ligand to a
              protein -- a task known as molecular docking -- is critical to drug
              design. Recent deep learning methods that treat docking as a
              regression problem have decreased runtime compared to traditional
              search-based methods but have yet to offer substantial improvements
              in accuracy. We instead frame molecular docking as a generative
              modeling problem and develop DiffDock, a diffusion generative model
              over the non-Euclidean manifold of ligand poses. To do so, we map
              this manifold to the product space of the degrees of freedom
              (translational, rotational, and torsional) involved in docking and
              develop an efficient diffusion process on this space. Empirically,
              DiffDock obtains a 38{\%} top-1 success rate (RMSD{\textless}2A) on
              PDBBind, significantly outperforming the previous state-of-the-art
              of traditional docking (23{\%}) and deep learning (20{\%}) methods.
              Moreover, while previous methods are not able to dock on
              computationally folded structures (maximum accuracy 10.4{\%}),
              DiffDock maintains significantly higher precision (21.7{\%}).
              Finally, DiffDock has fast inference times and provides confidence
