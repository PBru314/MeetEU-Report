  abstract = {{We here present AutoGrow4, an open-source program for
              semi-automated computer-aided drug discovery. AutoGrow4 uses a
              genetic algorithm to evolve predicted ligands on demand and so is
              not limited to a virtual library of pre-enumerated compounds. It is
              a useful tool for generating entirely novel drug-like molecules and
              for optimizing preexisting ligands. By leveraging recent
              computational and cheminformatics advancements, AutoGrow4 is faster
              , more stable, and more modular than previous versions. It
              implements new docking-program compatibility, chemical filters,
              multithreading options, and selection methods to support a wide
              range of user needs. To illustrate both de novo design and lead
              optimization, we here apply AutoGrow4 to the catalytic domain of
              poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1), a well characterized
              DNA-damage-recognition protein. AutoGrow4 produces drug-like
              compounds with better predicted binding affinities than
              FDA-approved PARP-1 inhibitors (positive controls). The predicted
              binding modes of the AutoGrow4 compounds mimic those of the known
              inhibitors, even when AutoGrow4 is seeded with random small
              molecules. AutoGrow4 is available under the terms of the Apache

   note = {},
   abstract = {MOTIVATION: The binding sites of proteins generally contain smaller regions that provide major contributions to the binding free energy and hence are the prime targets in drug design. Screening libraries of fragment-sized compounds by NMR or X-ray crystallography demonstrates that such 'hot spot' regions bind a large variety of small organic molecules, and that a relatively high 'hit rate' is predictive of target sites that are likely to bind drug-like ligands with high affinity. Our goal is to determine the 'hot spots' computationally rather than experimentally. RESULTS: We have developed the FTMAP algorithm that performs global search of the entire protein surface for regions that bind a number of small organic probe molecules. The search is based on the extremely efficient fast Fourier transform (FFT) correlation approach which can sample billions of probe positions on dense translational and rotational grids, but can use only sums of correlation functions for scoring and hence is generally restricted to very simple energy expressions. The novelty of FTMAP is that we were able to incorporate and represent on grids a detailed energy expression, resulting in a very accurate identification of low-energy probe clusters. Overlapping clusters of different probes are defined as consensus sites (CSs). We show that the largest CS is generally located at the most important subsite of the protein binding site, and the nearby smaller CSs identify other important subsites. Mapping results are presented for elastase whose structure has been solved in aqueous solutions of eight organic solvents, and we show that FTMAP provides very similar information. The second application is to renin, a long-standing pharmaceutical target for the treatment of hypertension, and we show that the major CSs trace out the shape of the first approved renin inhibitor, aliskiren. AVAILABILITY: FTMAP is available as a server at http://ftmap.bu.edu/.},

Here, we present significant enhancements to PrankWeb. First, a new, more accurate evolutionary conservation estimation pipeline based on the UniRef50 sequence database and the HMMER3 package is introduced. Second, PrankWeb now allows users to enter UniProt ID to carry out LBS predictions in situations where no experimental structure is available by utilizing the AlphaFold model database. Additionally, a range of minor improvements has been implemented. These include the ability to deploy PrankWeb and P2Rank as Docker containers, support for the mmCIF file format, improved public REST API access, or the ability to batch download the LBS predictions for the whole PDB archive and parts of the AlphaFold database.},

P2Rank is a template-free machine learning method based on the prediction of local chemical neighborhood ligandability centered on points placed on a solvent-accessible protein surface. Points with a high ligandability score are then clustered to form the resulting ligand binding sites. In addition, PrankWeb provides a web interface enabling users to easily carry out the prediction and visually inspect the predicted binding sites via an integrated sequence-structure view. Moreover, PrankWeb can determine sequence conservation for the input molecule and use this in both the prediction and result visualization steps. Alongside its online visualization options, PrankWeb also offers the possibility of exporting the results as a PyMOL script for offline visualization. The web frontend communicates with the server side via a REST API. In high-throughput scenarios, therefore, users can utilize the server API directly, bypassing the need for a web-based frontend or installation of the P2Rank application. PrankWeb is available at http://prankweb.cz/, while the web application source code and the P2Rank method can be accessed at https://github.com/jendelel/PrankWebApp and https://github.com/rdk/p2rank, respectively.},

The SARS-CoV-2 Non-structural protein 13 (NSP13) has been identified as a target for anti-virals due to its high sequence conservation and essential role in viral replication. Structural analysis reveals two “druggable” pockets on NSP13 that are among the most conserved sites in the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Here we present crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 solved in the APO form and in the presence of both phosphate and a non-hydrolysable ATP analog. Comparisons of these structures reveal details of conformational changes that provide insights into the helicase mechanism and possible modes of inhibition. To identify starting points for drug development we have performed a crystallographic fragment screen against NSP13. The screen reveals 65 fragment hits across 52 datasets opening the way to structure guided development of novel antiviral agents.},

              billions based on inexpensive make-on-demand compounds, simply
              searching this space becomes a major challenge. We have therefore
              developed ZINC20, a new version of ZINC with two major new
              features: billions of new molecules and new methods to search them.
              As a fully enumerated database, ZINC can be searched precisely
              using explicit atomic-level graph-based methods, such as SmallWorld
              for similarity and Arthor for pattern and substructure search, as
              well as 3D methods such as docking. Analysis of the new
              make-on-demand compound sets by these and related tools reveals
              startling features. For instance, over 97{\%} of the core
              Bemis-Murcko scaffolds in make-on-demand libraries are unavailable
              from {\textquotedbl}in-stock{\textquotedbl} collections.
              Correspondingly, the number of new Bemis-Murcko scaffolds is rising
              almost as a linear fraction of the elaborated molecules. Thus, an
              88-fold increase in the number of molecules in the make-on-demand
              versus the in-stock sets is built upon a 16-fold increase in the
              number of Bemis-Murcko scaffolds. The make-on-demand library is
              also more structurally diverse than physical libraries, with a
              massive increase in disc- and sphere-like shaped molecules. The new

              simulations accurately describes both folded and disordered

              state-of-the-art force fields, and compare the results to over 9,

              of the secondary structure propensities of disordered proteins.
              Guided by simulation results on a subset of our benchmark, however,

 abstract = {Predicting the binding structure of a small molecule ligand to a protein -- a task known as molecular docking -- is critical to drug design. Recent deep learning methods that treat docking as a regression problem have decreased runtime compared to traditional search-based methods but have yet to offer substantial improvements in accuracy. We instead frame molecular docking as a generative modeling problem and develop DiffDock, a diffusion generative model over the non-Euclidean manifold of ligand poses. To do so, we map this manifold to the product space of the degrees of freedom (translational, rotational, and torsional) involved in docking and develop an efficient diffusion process on this space. Empirically, DiffDock obtains a 38{\%} top-1 success rate (RMSD{\textless}2A) on PDBBind, significantly outperforming the previous state-of-the-art of traditional docking (23{\%}) and deep learning (20{\%}) methods. Moreover, while previous methods are not able to dock on computationally folded structures (maximum accuracy 10.4{\%}), DiffDock maintains significantly higher precision (21.7{\%}). Finally, DiffDock has fast inference times and provides confidence estimates with high selective accuracy.

In many cases, two, or even three, protein sites are employed to probe the sensitivity of the results to the site geometry. To make the database screens as realistic as possible, the screens use sets of {\textquotedbl}druglike{\textquotedbl} decoy ligands that have been selected to be representative of what we believe is likely to be found in the compound collection of a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company. Results are presented for releases 1.8, 2.0, and 2.5 of Glide. The comparisons show that average measures for both {\textquotedbl}early{\textquotedbl} and {\textquotedbl}global{\textquotedbl} enrichment for Glide 2.5 are 3 times higher than for Glide 1.8 and more than 2 times higher than for Glide 2.0 because of better results for the least well-handled screens. This improvement in enrichment stems largely from the better balance of the more widely parametrized GlideScore 2.5 function and the inclusion of terms that penalize ligand-protein interactions that violate established principles of physical chemistry, particularly as it concerns the exposure to solvent of charged protein and ligand groups. Comparisons to results for the thymidine kinase and estrogen receptors published by Rognan and co-workers (J. Med. Chem. 2000, 43, 4759-4767) show that Glide 2.5 performs better than GOLD 1.1, FlexX 1.8, or DOCK 4.01.},

  abstract = {{Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is a valuable tool for
              characterizing the structural dynamics of folded proteins and
              should be similarly applicable to disordered proteins and proteins
              with both folded and disordered regions. It has been unclear,
              however, whether any physical model (force field) used in MD
              simulations accurately describes both folded and disordered
              proteins. Here, we select a benchmark set of 21 systems, including
              folded and disordered proteins, simulate these systems with six
              state-of-the-art force fields, and compare the results to over 9,
              000 available experimental data points. We find that none of the
              tested force fields simultaneously provided accurate descriptions
              of folded proteins, of the dimensions of disordered proteins, and
              of the secondary structure propensities of disordered proteins.
              Guided by simulation results on a subset of our benchmark, however,
              we modified parameters of one force field, achieving excellent
              agreement with experiment for disordered proteins, while
              maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy for folded proteins. The
              resulting force field, a99SB-disp, should thus greatly expand the
              range of biological systems amenable to MD simulation. A similar
              approach could be taken to improve other force fields.}},

Protein structure-based methods are useful for the prediction of binding modes of small molecules and their relative affinity. The high-throughput docking of up to 106 small molecules followed by scoring based on implicit-solvent force field can robustly identify micromolar binders using a rigid protein target. Molecular dynamics with explicit solvent is a low-throughput technique for the characterization of flexible binding sites and accurate evaluation of binding pathways, kinetics, and thermodynamics. In this review we highlight recent advancements in applications of ligand docking tools and molecular dynamics simulations to ligand identification and optimization.},
