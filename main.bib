              not limited to a virtual library of pre-enumerated compounds. It is
              a useful tool for generating entirely novel drug-like molecules and
              for optimizing preexisting ligands. By leveraging recent
              computational and cheminformatics advancements, AutoGrow4 is faster
              , more stable, and more modular than previous versions. It
              implements new docking-program compatibility, chemical filters,
              multithreading options, and selection methods to support a wide
              range of user needs. To illustrate both de novo design and lead
              optimization, we here apply AutoGrow4 to the catalytic domain of
              poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1), a well characterized
              DNA-damage-recognition protein. AutoGrow4 produces drug-like
              compounds with better predicted binding affinities than
              FDA-approved PARP-1 inhibitors (positive controls). The predicted
              binding modes of the AutoGrow4 compounds mimic those of the known

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: The binding sites of proteins generally contain
              smaller regions that provide major contributions to the binding
              free energy and hence are the prime targets in drug design.
              Screening libraries of fragment-sized compounds by NMR or X-ray
              crystallography demonstrates that such 'hot spot' regions bind a
              large variety of small organic molecules, and that a relatively
              high 'hit rate' is predictive of target sites that are likely to
              bind drug-like ligands with high affinity. Our goal is to determine
              the 'hot spots' computationally rather than experimentally.
              RESULTS: We have developed the FTMAP algorithm that performs global
              search of the entire protein surface for regions that bind a number
              of small organic probe molecules. The search is based on the
              extremely efficient fast Fourier transform (FFT) correlation
              approach which can sample billions of probe positions on dense
              translational and rotational grids, but can use only sums of
              correlation functions for scoring and hence is generally restricted
              to very simple energy expressions. The novelty of FTMAP is that we
              were able to incorporate and represent on grids a detailed energy
              expression, resulting in a very accurate identification of
              low-energy probe clusters. Overlapping clusters of different probes
              are defined as consensus sites (CSs). We show that the largest CS
              is generally located at the most important subsite of the protein
              binding site, and the nearby smaller CSs identify other important
              subsites. Mapping results are presented for elastase whose
              structure has been solved in aqueous solutions of eight organic
              solvents, and we show that FTMAP provides very similar information.
              The second application is to renin, a long-standing pharmaceutical
              target for the treatment of hypertension, and we show that the
              major CSs trace out the shape of the first approved renin inhibitor
              , aliskiren. AVAILABILITY: FTMAP is available as a server at
              http://ftmap.bu.edu/.},

              purchasable chemical space continues to grow into the tens of
              billions based on inexpensive make-on-demand compounds, simply
              searching this space becomes a major challenge. We have therefore
              developed ZINC20, a new version of ZINC with two major new
              features: billions of new molecules and new methods to search them.
              As a fully enumerated database, ZINC can be searched precisely
              using explicit atomic-level graph-based methods, such as SmallWorld
              for similarity and Arthor for pattern and substructure search, as
              well as 3D methods such as docking. Analysis of the new
              make-on-demand compound sets by these and related tools reveals
              startling features. For instance, over 97{\%} of the core
              Bemis-Murcko scaffolds in make-on-demand libraries are unavailable
              from {\textquotedbl}in-stock{\textquotedbl} collections.
              Correspondingly, the number of new Bemis-Murcko scaffolds is rising
              almost as a linear fraction of the elaborated molecules. Thus, an
              88-fold increase in the number of molecules in the make-on-demand
              versus the in-stock sets is built upon a 16-fold increase in the
              number of Bemis-Murcko scaffolds. The make-on-demand library is
              also more structurally diverse than physical libraries, with a
              massive increase in disc- and sphere-like shaped molecules. The new

              however, whether any physical model (force field) used in MD
              simulations accurately describes both folded and disordered
              proteins. Here, we select a benchmark set of 21 systems, including
              folded and disordered proteins, simulate these systems with six
              state-of-the-art force fields, and compare the results to over 9,
              000 available experimental data points. We find that none of the

              of folded proteins, of the dimensions of disordered proteins, and
              of the secondary structure propensities of disordered proteins.
              Guided by simulation results on a subset of our benchmark, however,
              we modified parameters of one force field, achieving excellent
              agreement with experiment for disordered proteins, while
              maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy for folded proteins. The

              in accuracy. We instead frame molecular docking as a generative

              over the non-Euclidean manifold of ligand poses. To do so, we map
              this manifold to the product space of the degrees of freedom
              (translational, rotational, and torsional) involved in docking and
              develop an efficient diffusion process on this space. Empirically,
              DiffDock obtains a 38{\%} top-1 success rate (RMSD{\textless}2A) on

  abstract = {Abstract The AutoDock suite provides a comprehensive toolset for
              computational ligand docking and drug design and development. The
              suite builds on 30 years of methods development, including
              empirical free energy force fields, docking engines, methods for
              site prediction, and interactive tools for visualization and
              analysis. Specialized tools are available for challenging systems,
              including covalent inhibitors, peptides, compounds with macrocycles
              , systems where ordered hydration plays a key role, and systems
              with substantial receptor flexibility. All methods in the AutoDock
              suite are freely available for use and reuse, which has engendered
              the continued growth of a diverse community of primary users and
              third-party developers.},

           solution using Autodock Vina},

  abstract = {As an important theoretical computation method in computer-aided
              drug design, molecular docking has significantly shifted the
              paradigm of drug discovery. As one of the open-source docking
              software, Autodock Vina (Vina) is widely popular, but the lack of
              relevant experience and inappropriate docking parameters make it
              unable to perform optimally in practical application scenarios,
              which leads to potential failure risks in the early stage of drug
              discovery. In order to simplify the docking steps and determine the
              most appropriate docking parameters, a universal solution for rigid
              receptor docking using Vina has been proposed in this paper, and a
              user-friendly software for the entire process of molecular docking
              using Vina is developed. The case studies show that our docking
              solution is able to be applied to different docking scenarios to
              facilitate a more accurate, faster, and more convenient new drug
              discovery process.},

  abstract = {Structure-based virtual screening plays an important role in drug
              discovery and complements other screening approaches. In general,
              protein crystal structures are prepared prior to docking in order
              to add hydrogen atoms, optimize hydrogen bonds, remove atomic
              clashes, and perform other operations that are not part of the
              x-ray crystal structure refinement process. In addition, ligands
              must be prepared to create 3-dimensional geometries, assign proper
              bond orders, and generate accessible tautomer and ionization states
              prior to virtual screening. While the prerequisite for proper
              system preparation is generally accepted in the field, an extensive
              study of the preparation steps and their effect on virtual
              screening enrichments has not been performed. In this work, we
              systematically explore each of the steps involved in preparing a
              system for virtual screening. We first explore a large number of
              parameters using the Glide validation set of 36 crystal structures
              and 1,000 decoys. We then apply a subset of protocols to the DUD
              database. We show that database enrichment is improved with proper
              preparation and that neglecting certain steps of the preparation
              process produces a systematic degradation in enrichments, which can
              be large for some targets. We provide examples illustrating the
              structural changes introduced by the preparation that impact
              database enrichment. While the work presented here was performed
              with the Protein Preparation Wizard and Glide, the insights and
              guidance are expected to be generalizable to structure-based
              virtual screening with other docking methods.},
