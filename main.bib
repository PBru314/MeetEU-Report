@article{Irwin.2020,
 abstract = {Identifying and purchasing new small molecules to test in biological assays are enabling for ligand discovery, but as purchasable chemical space continues to grow into the tens of billions based on inexpensive make-on-demand compounds, simply searching this space becomes a major challenge. We have therefore developed ZINC20, a new version of ZINC with two major new features: billions of new molecules and new methods to search them. As a fully enumerated database, ZINC can be searched precisely using explicit atomic-level graph-based methods, such as SmallWorld for similarity and Arthor for pattern and substructure search, as well as 3D methods such as docking. Analysis of the new make-on-demand compound sets by these and related tools reveals startling features. For instance, over 97{\%} of the core Bemis-Murcko scaffolds in make-on-demand libraries are unavailable from {\textquotedbl}in-stock{\textquotedbl} collections. Correspondingly, the number of new Bemis-Murcko scaffolds is rising almost as a linear fraction of the elaborated molecules. Thus, an 88-fold increase in the number of molecules in the make-on-demand versus the in-stock sets is built upon a 16-fold increase in the number of Bemis-Murcko scaffolds. The make-on-demand library is also more structurally diverse than physical libraries, with a massive increase in disc- and sphere-like shaped molecules. The new system is freely available at zinc20.docking.org.},

@article{package_Autogrow4,
 abstract = {We here present AutoGrow4, an open-source program for

semi-automated computer-aided drug discovery. AutoGrow4 uses a

genetic algorithm to evolve predicted ligands on demand and so is

not limited to a virtual library of pre-enumerated compounds. It is

a useful tool for generating entirely novel drug-like molecules and

for optimizing preexisting ligands. By leveraging recent

computational and cheminformatics advancements, AutoGrow4 is faster

, more stable, and more modular than previous versions. It

implements new docking-program compatibility, chemical filters,

multithreading options, and selection methods to support a wide

range of user needs. To illustrate both de novo design and lead

optimization, we here apply AutoGrow4 to the catalytic domain of

poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1), a well characterized

DNA-damage-recognition protein. AutoGrow4 produces drug-like

compounds with better predicted binding affinities than

FDA-approved PARP-1 inhibitors (positive controls). The predicted

binding modes of the AutoGrow4 compounds mimic those of the known

inhibitors, even when AutoGrow4 is seeded with random small

molecules. AutoGrow4 is available under the terms of the Apache

License, Version 2.0. A copy can be downloaded free of charge from

@article{package_GROMACS,
 abstract = {GROMACS is one of the most widely used open-source and free

software codes in chemistry, used primarily for dynamical

simulations of biomolecules. It provides a rich set of calculation

types, preparation and analysis tools. Several advanced techniques

for free-energy calculations are supported. In version 5, it

reaches new performance heights, through several new and enhanced

parallelization algorithms. These work on every level; SIMD

registers inside cores, multithreading, heterogeneous CPU--GPU

acceleration, state-of-the-art 3D domain decomposition, and

ensemble-level parallelization through built-in replica exchange

and the separate Copernicus framework. The latest best-in-class

compressed trajectory storage format is supported.},
