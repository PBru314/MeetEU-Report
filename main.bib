@article{Irwin.2020,
  abstract = {Identifying and purchasing new small molecules to test in
              biological assays are enabling for ligand discovery, but as
              purchasable chemical space continues to grow into the tens of
              billions based on inexpensive make-on-demand compounds, simply
              searching this space becomes a major challenge. We have therefore
              developed ZINC20, a new version of ZINC with two major new
              features: billions of new molecules and new methods to search them.
              As a fully enumerated database, ZINC can be searched precisely
              using explicit atomic-level graph-based methods, such as SmallWorld
              for similarity and Arthor for pattern and substructure search, as
              well as 3D methods such as docking. Analysis of the new
              make-on-demand compound sets by these and related tools reveals
              startling features. For instance, over 97{\%} of the core
              Bemis-Murcko scaffolds in make-on-demand libraries are unavailable
              from {\textquotedbl}in-stock{\textquotedbl} collections.
              Correspondingly, the number of new Bemis-Murcko scaffolds is rising
              almost as a linear fraction of the elaborated molecules. Thus, an
              88-fold increase in the number of molecules in the make-on-demand
              versus the in-stock sets is built upon a 16-fold increase in the
              number of Bemis-Murcko scaffolds. The make-on-demand library is
              also more structurally diverse than physical libraries, with a
              massive increase in disc- and sphere-like shaped molecules. The new
              system is freely available at zinc20.docking.org.},

  abstract = {{We here present AutoGrow4, an open-source program for
              semi-automated computer-aided drug discovery. AutoGrow4 uses a
              genetic algorithm to evolve predicted ligands on demand and so is
              not limited to a virtual library of pre-enumerated compounds. It is
              a useful tool for generating entirely novel drug-like molecules and
              for optimizing preexisting ligands. By leveraging recent
              computational and cheminformatics advancements, AutoGrow4 is faster
              , more stable, and more modular than previous versions. It
              implements new docking-program compatibility, chemical filters,
              multithreading options, and selection methods to support a wide
              range of user needs. To illustrate both de novo design and lead
              optimization, we here apply AutoGrow4 to the catalytic domain of
              poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1), a well characterized
              DNA-damage-recognition protein. AutoGrow4 produces drug-like
              compounds with better predicted binding affinities than
              FDA-approved PARP-1 inhibitors (positive controls). The predicted
              binding modes of the AutoGrow4 compounds mimic those of the known
              inhibitors, even when AutoGrow4 is seeded with random small
              molecules. AutoGrow4 is available under the terms of the Apache

              with both folded and disordered regions. It has been unclear,
              however, whether any physical model (force field) used in MD
              simulations accurately describes both folded and disordered
              proteins. Here, we select a benchmark set of 21 systems, including
              folded and disordered proteins, simulate these systems with six
              state-of-the-art force fields, and compare the results to over 9,
              000 available experimental data points. We find that none of the
              tested force fields simultaneously provided accurate descriptions
              of folded proteins, of the dimensions of disordered proteins, and
              of the secondary structure propensities of disordered proteins.
              Guided by simulation results on a subset of our benchmark, however,
              we modified parameters of one force field, achieving excellent
              agreement with experiment for disordered proteins, while
              maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy for folded proteins. The
              resulting force field, a99SB-disp, should thus greatly expand the
              range of biological systems amenable to MD simulation. A similar
              approach could be taken to improve other force fields.}},

                  popular technique for studying the atomistic behavior of any
                  molecular system. Performing MD simulations requires a user to
                  become familiar with the commands, options, and 1le formats of
                  the chosen simulation software, none of which are consistent
                  across different programs. Beyond these requirements, users are
                  expected to be familiar with various aspects of physics,
                  mathematics, computer programming, and interaction with a
                  command-line environment, presenting critical barriers to entry
                  in the MD simulation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This
                  article presents seven tutorials for instructing users in the
                  proper methods for preparing and carrying out different types
                  of MD simulations in the popular GROMACS simulation package.
                  GROMACS is an open-source, free, and flexible MD package that
                  is consistently among the fastest in the world. The tutorials
                  presented here range from a &amp;quot;simple&amp;quot; system
                  of a protein in aqueous solution to more advanced concepts such
