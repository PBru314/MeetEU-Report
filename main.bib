  abstract = {{We here present AutoGrow4, an open-source program for
              semi-automated computer-aided drug discovery. AutoGrow4 uses a
              genetic algorithm to evolve predicted ligands on demand and so is
              not limited to a virtual library of pre-enumerated compounds. It is
              a useful tool for generating entirely novel drug-like molecules and
              for optimizing preexisting ligands. By leveraging recent
              computational and cheminformatics advancements, AutoGrow4 is faster
              , more stable, and more modular than previous versions. It
              implements new docking-program compatibility, chemical filters,
              multithreading options, and selection methods to support a wide
              range of user needs. To illustrate both de novo design and lead
              optimization, we here apply AutoGrow4 to the catalytic domain of
              poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1), a well characterized
              DNA-damage-recognition protein. AutoGrow4 produces drug-like
              compounds with better predicted binding affinities than
              FDA-approved PARP-1 inhibitors (positive controls). The predicted
              binding modes of the AutoGrow4 compounds mimic those of the known
              inhibitors, even when AutoGrow4 is seeded with random small
              molecules. AutoGrow4 is available under the terms of the Apache

   note = {},
   abstract = {MOTIVATION: The binding sites of proteins generally contain smaller regions that provide major contributions to the binding free energy and hence are the prime targets in drug design. Screening libraries of fragment-sized compounds by NMR or X-ray crystallography demonstrates that such 'hot spot' regions bind a large variety of small organic molecules, and that a relatively high 'hit rate' is predictive of target sites that are likely to bind drug-like ligands with high affinity. Our goal is to determine the 'hot spots' computationally rather than experimentally. RESULTS: We have developed the FTMAP algorithm that performs global search of the entire protein surface for regions that bind a number of small organic probe molecules. The search is based on the extremely efficient fast Fourier transform (FFT) correlation approach which can sample billions of probe positions on dense translational and rotational grids, but can use only sums of correlation functions for scoring and hence is generally restricted to very simple energy expressions. The novelty of FTMAP is that we were able to incorporate and represent on grids a detailed energy expression, resulting in a very accurate identification of low-energy probe clusters. Overlapping clusters of different probes are defined as consensus sites (CSs). We show that the largest CS is generally located at the most important subsite of the protein binding site, and the nearby smaller CSs identify other important subsites. Mapping results are presented for elastase whose structure has been solved in aqueous solutions of eight organic solvents, and we show that FTMAP provides very similar information. The second application is to renin, a long-standing pharmaceutical target for the treatment of hypertension, and we show that the major CSs trace out the shape of the first approved renin inhibitor, aliskiren. AVAILABILITY: FTMAP is available as a server at http://ftmap.bu.edu/.},

   abstract = {Knowledge of protein–ligand binding sites (LBSs) enables research ranging from protein function annotation to structure-based drug design. To this end, we have previously developed a stand-alone tool, P2Rank, and the web server PrankWeb (https://prankweb.cz/) for fast and accurate LBS prediction. Here, we present significant enhancements to PrankWeb. First, a new, more accurate evolutionary conservation estimation pipeline based on the UniRef50 sequence database and the HMMER3 package is introduced. Second, PrankWeb now allows users to enter UniProt ID to carry out LBS predictions in situations where no experimental structure is available by utilizing the AlphaFold model database. Additionally, a range of minor improvements has been implemented. These include the ability to deploy PrankWeb and P2Rank as Docker containers, support for the mmCIF file format, improved public REST API access, or the ability to batch download the LBS predictions for the whole PDB archive and parts of the AlphaFold database.},

   abstract = {PrankWeb is an online resource providing an interface to P2Rank, a state-of-the-art method for ligand binding site prediction. P2Rank is a template-free machine learning method based on the prediction of local chemical neighborhood ligandability centered on points placed on a solvent-accessible protein surface. Points with a high ligandability score are then clustered to form the resulting ligand binding sites. In addition, PrankWeb provides a web interface enabling users to easily carry out the prediction and visually inspect the predicted binding sites via an integrated sequence-structure view. Moreover, PrankWeb can determine sequence conservation for the input molecule and use this in both the prediction and result visualization steps. Alongside its online visualization options, PrankWeb also offers the possibility of exporting the results as a PyMOL script for offline visualization. The web frontend communicates with the server side via a REST API. In high-throughput scenarios, therefore, users can utilize the server API directly, bypassing the need for a web-based frontend or installation of the P2Rank application. PrankWeb is available at http://prankweb.cz/, while the web application source code and the P2Rank method can be accessed at https://github.com/jendelel/PrankWebApp and https://github.com/rdk/p2rank, respectively.},

   abstract = {There is currently a lack of effective drugs to treat people infected with SARS-CoV-2, the cause of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 Non-structural protein 13 (NSP13) has been identified as a target for anti-virals due to its high sequence conservation and essential role in viral replication. Structural analysis reveals two “druggable” pockets on NSP13 that are among the most conserved sites in the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Here we present crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 solved in the APO form and in the presence of both phosphate and a non-hydrolysable ATP analog. Comparisons of these structures reveal details of conformational changes that provide insights into the helicase mechanism and possible modes of inhibition. To identify starting points for drug development we have performed a crystallographic fragment screen against NSP13. The screen reveals 65 fragment hits across 52 datasets opening the way to structure guided development of novel antiviral agents.},
