  \caption*{\textbf{Workflow for the discovery of NSP13 helicase inhibitors.} Following preparation of ligands with from the ZINC and ECBD databases with \textcite{OpenBabel} and PDB preparation with \textit{PDBFixer}, the consensus pocket of 6ZSL NSP13 helicase of SARS-CoV-2 was detected using \textit{Fpocket}. Molecular Docking was first performed with \textit{AutoDock Vina} and results were validated using \textit{Glide} and textit{DiffDock}. The toxicity and synthetic accessibility of the \textit{AutoDock Vina} top scorers was determined using \textit{eToxPred} and lastly a molecular dynamics simulation with \textit{Gromacs} was performed to validate novel drug candidates.}

\section{Material and Methods}
\subsection{Datasets from ZINC20 and ECBD}
A total of 1616 FDA-approved drugs were downloaded in \textit{.sdf} format from the ZINC database \cite{Irwin.2020}. Additionally, 5016 files from the ECBD pilot library were downloaded.

\subsection{Receptor and Ligand Preparation}
Three protein structures of NSP13 (PDB codes: 6ZSL, 5RME, and 5RM2) were downloaded from RCSB PDB for consensus pocket detection. Further analysis was conducted using the A chain of 6ZSL that was prepared using \textit{PDBFixer} \cite{Eastman_2017}. Ligands were prepared using \textit{OpenBabel} \cite{OpenBabel}.

\subsection{Consensus binding site detection}
\text{Fpocket} \cite{package_Fpocket}, \textit{PrankWeb 3} \cite{package_P2Rank,package_PrankWeb,package_PrankWeb3}, and \textit{FTMap} \cite{package_FTMAP} were used for pocket detection. The docking box was set to have an edge length of 30 \AA.

\subsection{Molecular Docking}
Molecular docking was performed using \textit{AutoDock Vina} \cite{Trott.2010} and \textit{Glide} \cite{Friesner2004}. Docking results were validated through blind docking with \textit{DiffDock} \cite{Corso.2022}.

\subsection{Estimation of Toxicity and Synthetic Accessibility}
Toxicity and synthetic accessibility of the Top 100 scorers from \textit{AutoDock Vina} were predicted using \textit{eToxPred} \cite{pu2019toxpred}.

\subsection{Molecular Dynamics Simulation}
In order to validate the binding of the top scorer, a molecular dynamics simulation was performed using \textit{Gromacs} \cite{packageGROMACS}.
